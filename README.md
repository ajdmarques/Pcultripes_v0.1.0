We compare the results of eight tests for selection, representing three methodological approaches, in a range-wide genomic scan of an Iberian amphibian, Pelobates cultripes.

Code for analysis and figures is available in code. Raw data with DarTseq genotypes and sample metadata are available in data/raw. 

Intermediate results from scripts are stored in data/intermediate. Final outputs and figures are saved in data/final.

The version of R packages used can be found here.
